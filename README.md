## Description
The goal of this project was to clean up redundancies and broken links in the provided Horiseon webpage. Using the provided code I found several classes which had the same attributes and combined them to funciton as one repeating call. I learned a good bit about anchoring IDs, creating classes, and providing meta data, along with a familiarity with HTML and CSS.
